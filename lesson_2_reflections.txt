What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A directory on your computer is now being tracked by Git. You want to do this for version control of the files in
the directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is sort of fictional. It is a holding place for Git, to track which files are going into the
next commit.
