When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on multiple computers or with multiple people on the same files/projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Otherwise you might get lost what is in Git and what is on GitHub. And you may not want to push certain commits
to GitHub just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of someone else's repository. Clone is a copy of your own, and a branch is just a different path
of your repository. Use the latter if you want to work on a different feature. Use a fork if you want to work
on somebody else's code but don't have permission to change it in their own repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can work from that one, and you are in sync with the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By email probably. Would be quick, but hard to keep track of versions and differences between versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Then you could first have a collaborator check the change. If you have any errors, they could be fixed before
changing the master
