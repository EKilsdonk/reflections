When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on multiple computers or with multiple people on the same files/projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Otherwise you might get lost what is in Git and what is on GitHub. And you may not want to push certain commits
to GitHub just yet.
